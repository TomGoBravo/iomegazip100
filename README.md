# Getting an Iomega zip 100 parallel storage drive running again 


I had an old Iomage Zip 100 drive with a parallel interface.

This README documents the setup on an old Windows XP machine with a parallel port.

1. Connect the drive as shown below and powe up. My drive did not autodetect, so I completed the following steps.
2. On XP Desktop goto 'Start' and rightclick on 'My Computer' and select 'Manage'
3. Select 'Device Manager' and expand 'Ports (COM & LPT)'
4. Right-click on 'Printer Port(LPT1)' and select 'Scan for hardware changes'

After completing these step my drive appeared.
Importantly, I did not have to download any of the dodgy drivers offered on the internet.

I was pleasantly supprised that the data on the drives was fully intact after all these years.
